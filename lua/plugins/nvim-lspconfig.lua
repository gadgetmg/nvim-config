    -- Brief aside: **What is LSP?**
    --
    -- LSP is an initialism you've probably heard, but might not understand what it is.
    --
    -- LSP stands for Language Server Protocol. It's a protocol that helps editors
    -- and language tooling communicate in a standardized fashion.
    --
    -- In general, you have a "server" which is some tool built to understand a particular
    -- language (such as `gopls`, `lua_ls`, `rust_analyzer`, etc.). These Language Servers
    -- (sometimes called LSP servers, but that's kind of like ATM Machine) are standalone
    -- processes that communicate with some "client" - in this case, Neovim!
    --
    -- LSP provides Neovim with features like:
    --  - Go to definition
    --  - Find references
    --  - Autocompletion
    --  - Symbol Search
    --  - and more!
    --
    -- Thus, Language Servers are external tools that must be installed separately from
    -- Neovim. This is where `mason` and related plugins come into play.
    --
    -- If you're wondering about lsp vs treesitter, you can check out the wonderfully
    -- and elegantly composed help section, `:help lsp-vs-treesitter`


    -- LSP servers and clients are able to communicate to each other what features they support.
    --  By default, Neovim doesn't support everything that is in the LSP specification.
    --  When you add nvim-cmp, luasnip, etc. Neovim now has *more* capabilities.
    --  So, we create new capabilities with nvim cmp, and then broadcast that to the servers.
    local capabilities = vim.lsp.protocol.make_client_capabilities()
    capabilities = vim.tbl_deep_extend("force", capabilities, require("cmp_nvim_lsp").default_capabilities())

    -- Enable the following language servers
    --  Feel free to add/remove any LSPs that you want here. They will automatically be installed.
    --
    --  Add any additional override configuration in the following tables. Available keys are:
    --  - cmd (table): Override the default command used to start the server
    --  - filetypes (table): Override the default list of associated filetypes for the server
    --  - capabilities (table): Override fields in capabilities. Can be used to disable certain LSP features.
    --  - settings (table): Override the default settings passed when initializing the server.
    --        For example, to see the options for `lua_ls`, you could go to: https://luals.github.io/wiki/settings/

    require 'lspconfig'.lua_ls.setup {
      settings = {
        Lua = {
          completion = {
            callSnippet = "Replace",
          },
          -- You can toggle below to ignore Lua_LS's noisy `missing-fields` warnings
          -- diagnostics = { disable = { 'missing-fields' } },
        },
      },
    }
    require 'lspconfig'.nil_ls.setup {}

    --  other tools, you can run
